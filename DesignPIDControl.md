# Description #

As this was my final year BE engineering project i wanted all the aspects of the project be custom made. So to actually make a "custom-made" standard PID controller for any application we require many parameters. Like Unit Step Respone of the whole system, and many other parameters as specified in ziggler nicholas loop. This is incomplete. why?? because in the ended we just interfaced it with industry standard loop transmitter so that well it becomes compatible with as many applications as possible.

This is series of images pages numbered. Just for my reference. I dont think this is going to help at all.
