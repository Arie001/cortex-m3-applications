LandTiger Without TFT Touch Screen<br>
<hr />

<h1>Why LandTiger??</h1>
<hr />
There were many reasons involved into buying a landtiger board.<br>
<ul><li>It had a on board TFT Touch Screen already interfaced at just $70. Here is the <a href='http://www.wayengineer.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=50_67'>link</a> to the other considered boards.<br>
</li><li>It is an almost full derivative of Keil's MCB1700. Meaning at almost half the price of MCB1700 we can use keils demo programs and extensive set of open source library.<br>
</li><li>It has lots and lots and lots of features. It is more than enough to get me good grade in my final year project.<br>
</li><li>It has breakout available for all of the IO's pins and can be easily interfaced(compared to other 32 bit boards) with external peripheries.</li></ul>

<h1>Features</h1>
<hr />
<ul><li>2 RS232 serial interfaces (using straight-through serial cable), (RS232 Transceiver: SP3232). One serial port supports ISP download of programs.<br>

</li><li>DAC output interface, on-board speaker and speaker output driver (LM386).<br>
</li><li>ADC input interface, on-board adjustable potentiometer input.<br>
</li><li>Color LCD display interface (supports 2.8-inch or 3.2-inch color TFT 320X240). Touchscreen supported through SPI interface.<br>
</li><li>USB2.0 Interface (USB host and USB Device interface).<br>
