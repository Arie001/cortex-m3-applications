# To whomsoever who cares #

As Google has deprecated the downloads feature for some "misuse" reason. All the downloads from now on will be shifted to SourceForge.

Although the downloads is shifted to sourceforge the source code under source tab will be updated simultaneously on both the sourceforge project and this google code project.

As first part of the project is completed. I will soon upload and try to update the wikis of both the projects. If time permits. Otherwise one can always sync the updated source.
